## Overview of internet
- web is geographically divided across different internet service providers (ISPs)
- 3 types of hardware components
    - host: laptop, smartphone, server 
    - communication links: fiber, radio
    - routers: hardware components for internet, packet switching
- network strucutre
    - edge: hosts, servers
    - access networks: wired/wireless links
    - core: connected routers

## Network edge
- different access networks
    - downstream speeds more important than upstream speeds
    - DSL
        - reuses telephone line 
    - cable
        - shared coax cable
    - ethernet
        - high speed network for enterprise
        - connected by ethernet switches 
- wireless networks
    - LAN
        - within a building
    - wide area
        - LTE, cellular services

## Network core
- mesh of interconnected routers
- routing: dtermines source-destination route taken by packets
- forwarding: moving packets from a router's input to another router's output
- packet-switching
    - break messages into packets
    - forward packets from routers to the next using routes computed 
    - transmit packets at full speed (back to back)
